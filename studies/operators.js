/**

 * Operators
 * 
 * 0. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple  
 * data values and gives you a result a result. There are six different 
 * kinds of operators.
 * 
 * 1. Assignment operator: An assignment operator assigns a value to its left 
 * operand based on the value of its right operand.
 */ 
 let x = 2;   // x is being assigned the value of 2
 
 let a = x;  // a is being assigned the value of x 
  
  
/* 
 * 2. Arithmetic Operator: An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals 
 * or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 3. Comparison Operator: Compares its operands and returns a logical value based on
 * whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object 
 * values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode
 * values. In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript attempts
 * to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison. This behavior generally results
 * in comparing the operands numerically. The sole exceptions to type conversion within 
 * comparisons involve the === and !== operators, which perform strict equality and inequality
 * comparisons. These operators do not attempt to convert the operands to compatible types before
 * checking equality. The following table describes the comparison operators in terms of this
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 4. Logical Operators: Typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they 
 * return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of
 * the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return
 * a non-Boolean value 
 *
 *
 * 
 * 
 * 5. Unary Operator:  An operation with only one operand.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 6. The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: 
 * a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy
 * followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator
 * is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement.
