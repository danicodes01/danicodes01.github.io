/**
 * Data Types
 * 
 * 0. Data structures that are built into javaScript. There are simple data types, and complex data types. 
 * simple data types are immutable, they do not hold or collect other values. they do not change the original value.
 * simple data types are copy by value. When we assign these variables to other variables using =, 
 * we copy the value to the new variable. They are copied by value.
 * 
 * Complex data types can take on a unlimited number of values. They can constantly grow, like collections.
 * Complex data types are copy by reference. When a reference type value, an object, is copied to another variable using =,
 * the address of that value is whatâ€™s actually copied over as if it were a primitive. Objects are copied by reference
 * instead of by value.
 *

 * 1. Number:  number is a numerica data type. 
 * infinity is also a number. it is a numeric value representing infinity.
 */

/*  
 * 2. String: Text wrapped in quotation marks. 
 */
