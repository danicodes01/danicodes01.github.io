/**
 * Control Flow
 * 
 * 0. The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
 * 
 * 1. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the 
 * computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, 
 * such as conditionals and loops. 
 * 
 * 2. Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to
 * finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.
 *
 *3. we can use conditional statements, or if else statements to change the control flow.
